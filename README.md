# Group 6 Seeds data analysizs

In this folder you will find the data analysis performed in the Rice_Cammeo_Osmancik.arff dataset - found in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds - done in Matlab, assigned to and done by Diego A Gomez Ruiz. 

The main folder mainly has the m files consitsting main file together with its helper user designed functions and the raw data.

## Running

If you want to run the code, clone the repository into a folder. Open the folder in Matlab and **run main.m file only**.

If given as a .zip, extract the folder, open the folder in Matlab and **run main.m file only**.

When the code is ran, 4 additional windows will be opened. These windows are graphs.

## Other

The `ResultingData` folder consists of excel files that has all the resulting data from the script. All the excel files have a self-explanatory title that explains its content.

The `Graphs` folder contains the graphical component of the data. Much like `ResultingData`, each file in the folder has a self-explanatory title that explains its content. Each file is a Matlab .fig file. To view the graphs, make sure you have Matlab in your system, and simply click on the one you want to look at.
